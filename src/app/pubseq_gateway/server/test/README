Unit tests
----------

The tests use the udc framework (see the udc NCBI facility).

To run the tests:
- make sure it is a Linux host
- make sure udc is in PATH (e.g. 'which udc')
- change the directory to this one
- check the psg.bash source code that it connects to the proper server instance
  (host:port are hardcoded there)
- run ./run_tests.py

It was forbidden to save the baseline files as is in SVN however it was allowed
to save a tar archive. So the wrapper script basically unpacks the baseline
files if needed and runs 'udc'.

Note: after changing test cases prepare a new archive with the baseline (someone
      insisted to have an archive in SVN)
tar -czf baseline.tar.gz baseline/



Manual tests for the resolution algorithm
-----------------------------------------

1. Make the csv snapshot of the SI2CSI table, e.g.
  /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/id_dumps/id_software/cassandra/test/bin/cqlsh idtest214 9042
  cqlsh> COPY idmain.si2csi (sec_seq_id, sec_seq_id_type, accession, seq_id_type, version) TO './si2csi.cass.dump';

2. Prepare the binary convert_to_fasta from the utils subdirectory

3. Have
   convert_to_fasta
   convert_to_fasta.sh
   si2csi_psg_test.py
   si2csi.cass.dump

   in the same directory and then run
   python3 -u ./si2csi_psg_test.py > output 2>&1

   NB: an exclusion file can also be supplied for the python script
