The tests use the udc framework (see the udc NCBI facility).

To run the tests:
- make sure it is a Linux host
- make sure udc is in PATH (e.g. 'which udc')
- change the directory to this one
- check the psg.bash source code that it connects to the proper server instance
  (host:port are hardcoded there)
- run ./run_tests.py

It was forbidden to save the baseline files as is in SVN however it was allowed
to save a tar archive. So the wrapper script basically unpacks the baseline
files if needed and runs 'udc'.

Note: after changing test cases prepare a new archive with the baseline (someone
      insisted to have an archive in SVN)
tar -czf baseline.tar.gz baseline/
