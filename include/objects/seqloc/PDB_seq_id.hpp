    // As with the *Chain-id methods, the identifier will be returned as a string and never an integer.
    // 
    // Conventions:
    //    a) single-character chain identifier: both fields hold this character
    //    b) multi-character chain identifier: chain_id holds this string; chain is unset

    //        or '|'and chain_id equals that chain's legacy encoding of a doubled uppercase character
    //        or "VB", respectively)
